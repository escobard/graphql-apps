# GraphQL applications

The purpose of this repository is to create some boilerplate applications that can be expanded in the future for client and personal projects.

In addition, this repository contains all of my own programming files, notes, applications, and libraries for the [GraphQL with React: The Complete Developers Guide](https://www.udemy.com/graphql-with-react-course/) course with [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com).
